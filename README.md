# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! üéÑ

I'm diving into this year's Advent of Code challenge mostly for the giggles and the holiday spirit. If you're here expecting to find the pinnacle of coding excellence, you might want to lower those expectations a tad. My strategy is more "speedy Gonzales" than "elegant Einstein," so brace yourself for some quick-and-dirty solutions!

I'm using Python to shake off some rust and remind myself that `print("Hello, World!")` is still a thing. üêç

Plus, I'm rushing through the challenges because I have to take care of my wife, my two daughters, my cat, and have a full-time job. So, it's more of a sprint than a marathon!

Feel free to peruse my code, but remember, it's more about solving quickly than achieving perfection. If you're up for the challenge yourself, check out the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2024) and join the fun!
